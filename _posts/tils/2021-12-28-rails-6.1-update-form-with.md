##### Problem

My form submit process as `WidgetsController#create as HTML` <br />
My expectation: `WidgetsController#create as JS`

##### Cause

Due to  [this PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40708)

Rails 6.0: `form_with` would generate a remote form by default.<br />
Rails 6.1: `form_with` would generate a non-remote form by default.

##### Solution

Update config `config/environments/*.rb`
```
config.action_view.form_with_generates_remote_forms = true
```
